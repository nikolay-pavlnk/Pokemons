# Pokemons

## First of all, i'd like to say that the quality of pictures is not the best. It happens because NN has trained with a small number of epochs(10000). The neural network has been trained for more than two days on my PC.
## Unfortunately, i can't afford a new powerful PC. But you can still try to train NN with more numbers of epochs. I believe the quality will increase


## To generate new picture of pokemon you need:
- Download generate.py, requirements.txt
- Execute command:pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Execute command: python3 generate.py
- The picture will appear in subdirectory(where generate.py exactly is)
